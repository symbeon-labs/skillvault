# SkillVault Roadmap: The Path to Sovereign Autarchy 🚀🌌

## Phase 1: The Hackathon Spark (Current)
- [x] Create the **SkillVault Engine** (Rust core).
- [x] Implement **x402 Micropayments** in `$SURGE`.
- [x] OpenClaw Plugin for agentic workflow integration.
- [x] Standardize `core.json` manifest.

## Phase 2: Mesh Integration (Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Multi-Wallet Support**: Integrate Phantom (Solana) and Ledger (Offline).
- [ ] **WASM Bridge**: Compile the Rust Engine to WebAssembly for browser-based AI models.
- [ ] **Distributed Discovery**: Implement a DHT-based (Distributed Hash Table) registry to replace the local file store.

## Phase 3: The Economic Layer (Q3 2026)
- [ ] **Automatic Royalty Splits**: Deploy the SkillVault Smart Contract on Base chain to handle splits on-chain.
- [ ] **Subscription Primitives**: Logic for recurring agent payments (monthly "Soul Access").
- [ ] **ZK-Identity**: Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to allow agents to prove they have a skill without revealing the code.

## Phase 4: Scaling & Acquisition (Q1 2027)
- [ ] **Agnostic Connector**: Standalone SDK for Python (LangChain/AutoGPT) and Go.
- [ ] **Skill Market**: A sovereign, peer-to-peer visual explorer for available agent skills.
- [ ] **Strategic Exit/Partnership**: Open for integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, or specialized Decentralized Compute providers.
